                    <h3>2. Counter-Notification Procedures</h3>
                    <p>If you believe that your content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the material in your content, you may send a counter-notification containing the following information to our copyright agent:</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>Your physical or electronic signature;</li>
                        <li>Identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;</li>
                        <li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the content; and</li>

                    <p>If a counter-notification is received by our copyright agent, TubeShortsGrab may send a copy of the counter-notification to the original complaining party informing that person that we may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at TubeShortsGrab's sole discretion.</p>

                    <h3>3. Repeat Infringer Policy</h3>
                    <p>TubeShortsGrab operates a strict policy for terminating, in appropriate circumstances, the service access of users who are repeat infringers. We reserve the right to terminate access for users who have been the subject of multiple valid DMCA notifications.</p>
